This project focuses on the recognition of Tamil characters from ancient stone inscriptions using deep learning techniques. The proposed framework integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), MobileNet, ResNet, and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to achieve high accuracy in character recognition, contributing to the preservation and understanding of Tamil Nadu's cultural heritage.
Proposed Methodology
The project utilizes a combination of CNN, MobileNet, ResNet, and DNN models for character recognition. Key steps include preprocessing (grayscale conversion, Gaussian blur, denoising, contrast enhancement), segmentation, and model development.

Preprocessing
Grayscale Conversion: Simplifies image representation.
Gaussian Blur: Reduces noise.
Denoising: Removes unwanted noise while preserving useful information.
Contrast Enhancement: Improves visual quality.
Segmentation
Techniques used include thresholding, edge detection, region-based segmentation, clustering, and contour detection to isolate individual characters.

Model Development
CNN: Achieved 98% accuracy, excelling in feature extraction and classification.
DNN: Utilizes multiple hidden layers, dropout layers, and batch normalization to handle complex patterns.
MobileNet: Lightweight architecture designed for mobile devices, achieving 91% accuracy.
ResNet: Employs skip connections to capture intricate features, enhancing performance.
